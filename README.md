## Installation

1. Install dependencies - `npm install`

2. Create a new file `.env` if it doesn't exist and copy the contents of `env.dev` into it to be able to run your server on production environment.

3. Then you need to provide values for the configuration env files at the `.env` file.

## Running the server (development)

2. Server should be running on http://localhost:PORT/ by default

## Running the server (production)
